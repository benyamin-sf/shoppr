# Shoppr üõí **Click with Confidence**

## Description

### Yet another e-commerce website (made through blood, sweat and tears üòÖ)

My first attempt to create a simple and cool, yet elegant e-commerce web application. I tried utilizing the awesome **JavaScript** and it's powerful **MERN** stack because I totally ‚ù§Ô∏è MERN and I believe it's an awesome set of tools for creating such full-stack applications. Down below I've listed all the tech stack and tools that used in creating Shoppr. You can also checkout the `Package.json` files inside the server and client directories for even more details. Shoppr is not a production-ready web application and I simply built it as a coding exercise project and also to showcase my newly learnt set of skills.

## Tech Stack

### Back-end

- **Node.js** (an awesome, mature javascript runtime)
- **Express** (server, with various dependencies for validation, security and etc.)
- **JWT** (jsonwebtoken, for secure user authentication and authorization)
- **bcryptjs** (a JS/TS implementation of bcrypt, a secure hashing library)
- **dayjs** (an awesome library, with plugins to work more efficiently with datetime)

### Database

- **MongoDB** (no explanation needed, an awesome noSQL database!)
- **mongoose** (THE mongodb ODM, elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js)

### Front-end

- **React** (the heart of the web interface, fast and efficient)
- **Redux** (a centralized store for state, to be accessed and modified across components)
- **React query** (for declarative, always up-to-date and auto-managed queries)
- **React router** (declarative routing for react web applications)
- **TailwindCSS** (amazing and lovely utility-first CSS framework, very customizable)
- **DaisyUI** (sits on top of Tailwind to provide component, themes, etc.)
- **React icons** (a nice set of free svg icons, from various providers)
- **React toastify** (add toasts üçû and notifications with ease and style)
- **Axios** (useful promise-based HTTP client for node.js and browser)
